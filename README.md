Othello engine

This is an Othello engine in plain simple java I once hacked together in a few evenings. 
It actually plays rather good (according to my standards :))
It needs some cleaning up and a rest interface so we can talk to it.
But the api should be rather straight forward.

There used to be a crappy ui on top of it and it still runs here http://mdothello.appspot.com/othello
That frontend code is not in this repo. But it plays so you can have an impression at the engine.

The commits to this repo will automatically be deployed to 
https://md-othello.herokuapp.com/swagger-ui.html#/othello-restcontroller

Getting this running should be a breeze.
Feel free to expand it and create pull requests for the api or clean up the code (because it works, but is 
damn ugly and there are no tests).

Happy hacking!
