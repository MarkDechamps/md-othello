Othello engine

This is an Othello engine in plain simple java I once hacked together in a few evenings. 
It actually plays rather good (according to my standards :))
It needs some cleaning up and a rest interface so we can talk to it.
But the api should be rather straight forward.

Some version of this runs on http://mdothello.appspot.com/othello
The ui is not bugfree but you can have a look.


enjoy!
